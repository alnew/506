I was in charge of land acquisitions. They would tell me: \u2018Bruno, go find opportunities for us.\u2019 I\u2019d locate good properties and then negotiate a price. I generated a lot of revenue. I felt powerful. When I spoke to rich people and politicians, I\u2019d feel like their equal. Not in an arrogant way. But I did not feel inferior when I spoke to them. Coming to New York has really challenged my confidence. I applied to over fifty companies when I arrived. Maybe one hundred. But nobody hired me. I have a new daughter coming in August, so now I\u2019m trying to work as a real estate broker. But that has been very difficult too. I\u2019ve only closed one deal so far, and I split that with another broker. Maybe it\u2019s because my English is not perfect. Recently I offended a wealthy lady by suggesting she clean her apartment before showing it. I showed her some dust and she told me to never come back. That was really tough for me because I was really proud of my people skills. And now it seemed that even those had left me. But I think that things are finally beginning to turn around. I have two closings scheduled this month. And yesterday I spent all day with a lady from China, and she barely spoke English, but at the end of the day, she told me: \u2018I trust you.\u2019\u201d"

It is the day my brother and several other innocent people lost their lives to a terrorist attack, praying at a mosque, a place of peace. The incident taught me what it means to lose someone close to you and yet move on with your life. I will never forget the horrific events of the day, however the reality holds that time waits for none, and each day brings with it new hopes, only if you look for them, and of course new struggles. I have learnt that you've got to keep moving no matter what, get up each day and strive. I learnt not to take things for granted because we have so much to be grateful for, our family, friends, a roof over our heads, the freedom to live our lives how we want. A lot of things people across the world don't. Living my parents grief broke me everyday, but we strived to keep each other strong and hopeful. I cannot thank my friends, family and everyone around at the time enough for all the physical and mental support they have given me and helping me getting to where I am today. Today marks the 6 years of the most tragic day of my life and there hasn't been a single day that I haven't thought about you brother but I know that God has kept you in a special place. \nI hope I do make a difference in this world and I hope people realize terrorists have no religion. This world could be a much better place if we realize the true essence of the wonderful blessings we have around us. Remember to be kind to everyone you meet."

            "message": "(1/4) \u201cI had a very brilliant teacher in elementary school. She was my role model. I don\u2019t remember deciding to be a teacher so much as I remember deciding that I wanted to be just like her. My whole life became about studying. I\u2019d learn every lesson early so that I could participate in class. When my siblings were playing games around the house, I\u2019d plug my ears and work on my homework. Education was my passion. It was all I thought about. I didn\u2019t even want to get married. I finished at the top of my class in both high school and university. I got a scholarship to pursue my Masters at a German university. Then I met a man who was very supportive of me going to school, so I decided to marry. But four months later he was killed in a car accident. And I was pregnant.\u201d\n(Amman, Jordan)"

We did everything together. The day that I left was a terrible day. We slept together in the same bed that night. We cried in the house, cried in the car, and cried at the airport. I stood at the entrance of airport security for an hour, because we kept waving at each other through the window. My goal is to bring her here. I found a job on the Monster website. I knock on doors for Verizon. I\u2019m supposed to knock on 120 doors a day. It has really been helping me with my English. If I make five sales in a week, I will have my own team. Then if my team does well, then I can be a manager with my own office. If I have my own office, then maybe I can bring my mom to America.\u201d"

To graduate, we had to do something called the Edelweiss March. An Edelweiss is a flower that only grows at 8,000 feet. So the Edelweiss March is when you carry 50 lbs of equipment for forty miles through the mountains. And at the end, you get this hat.\u201d"

Every day I take a walk in the park to think about my balance. I've been a chef, a fashion designer, a painter, and now I\u2019m learning martial arts. I do Tai Chi in the park every morning. It helps give me energy for my painting. I have already learned forty-two moves. I\u2019m ahead of everyone. I\u2019m almost eighty years old, but all the women in my group think I\u2019m in my fifties.\u201d"

He offered me a super dinner, a ride in a beautiful italian car, then let a place to stay in South Beach.\nToday I am the one who lost their iPhone last Thursday near Rosa sur Seine, a silver 5S with a black case. It\u2019s more than a phone, its my work tool. I lost all of my contacts abroad, my work notes, anyway it is very important to me. In the long run I don\u2019t care about the pictures, personal things are secondary.\nSo, if someone has found it, I\u2019m not promising you a ride in a beautiful italian car, but I dare to hope that people are still united together, as we have proven in since the most recent events.\n(This is my replacement phone.)"
